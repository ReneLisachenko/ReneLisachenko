<h1 align="center">Hey , I'm Rene Lisachenko</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Data Analyst from Tel Aviv, Israel.</h3>

Multilingual data analyst, who comes from a management background and has a long love of learning natural languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, English)  and lived in different countries, which allows me to quickly adapt to notice some cultural peculiarities. Through my past experiences I can  understand their weak points of business and check them as a data analyst and help them solve their problems.
I am constantly engaged in sports (Tennis, surfing, street training) and self-development in different areas (music, design).
